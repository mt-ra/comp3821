\begin{question}
A battle takes place between $n$ heroes and $m$ monsters. Let $h_j$ denote the starting amount of health points of monster $j$, where $1 \leq j \leq m$. During one round of the battle, each hero attacks a monster of their own choice, causing one damage to the monster's health points. If a monster's number of health points reduces to zero at any time, they are killed. At the end of each round, all monsters still alive will gain $k$ health points; therefore, a monster can exceed $h_j$ health points. The monsters will not attack any of the heroes.

The heroes win the battle if they manage to kill all of the monsters.

\begin{enumerate}[label = (\alph*)]
    \item Suppose that $k < n$. Describe a strategy that chooses which monster(s) to attack in each round, in order to guarantee victory for the heroes in the fewest number of rounds as possible.

    \item Prove that your algorithm guarantees that the heroes win.

    \item Briefly explain why your strategy guarantees that the heroes win in the fewest number of rounds possible.

    \item Now, suppose that $k \geq n$. Under what circumstance(s) can the heroes win the battle? Briefly explain why.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{question}
A {\em forest} is a collection of disjoint trees. In other words, a forest is an undirected and acyclic graph, where all of its components are trees. Prove that a forest with $k$ edges has $n - k$ connected components, where $n$ denotes the number of vertices in the forest.

\begin{solution}
    A tree containing $n$ vertices has $n-1$ edges. Let $C$ be the set of connected components. 
    Let $v(c)$ and $e(c)$ denote the number of vertices and edges in the component $c\in C$ respectively.

    Since the forest has $k$ edges, $\displaystyle\sum_{c\in C}e(c)=k$. Since the forest has $n$ vertices, $\displaystyle\sum_{c\in C}v(c)=n$.

    \begin{align*}
        k&=\sum_{c\in C} e(c)\\
        &=\sum_{c\in C} (v(c) - 1)\\
        &=\sum_{c\in C} v(c) - \sum_{c\in C} 1\\
        &= n-|C|\\
        \therefore |C|&=n-k
    \end{align*}
    Therefore the number of connected components is $n-k$.
\end{solution}

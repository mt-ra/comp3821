\begin{question}
A {\em dandelion} of length $k$ is an undirected graph that consists of a simple path of length $k$, followed by $k$ additional vertices connected to one of the endpoints.

Given a graph $G$, prove that it is $\mathsf{NP}$-hard to find the length of the longest dandelion subgraph of $G$.

{\bfseries Hint.} {\em $\compproblem{HamiltonianPath}$ is known to be $\mathsf{NP\text-C}$.}

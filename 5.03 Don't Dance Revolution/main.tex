\begin{question}
In the arcade game {\em Dance Dance Revolution} (DDR), players stand on a stage and hit arrows as they scroll across the screen. More specifically, a sequence of $n$ arrows (\twemoji{left arrow}, \twemoji{up arrow}, \twemoji{right arrow}, \twemoji{down arrow}) will scroll across the screen, and as each arrow hits the top of the screen, the player must stand on the corresponding arrow on the stage.

We play a variant of DDR, aptly named {\em Don't Dance Revolution} (DDR2), where the goal is to play the game like DDR but move as little as possible. The game plays like DDR except when an arrow reaches the top of the screen and the player already has a foot on the correct arrow, then the player is awarded one lazy point. If neither foot is on the correct arrow, then the player must move {\em exactly} one foot from its current location to the correct arrow on the platform.

Unfortunately, the game is a bit unforgiving: any wrong move will cause the player to lose the game and {\em all} of their lazy points. Wrong moves include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Failing to step on the correct arrow.
    \item Moving more than one foot at any given time.
    \item Moving either foot when the player is already stepping on the correct arrow.
\end{itemize}

You are given a sequence $A$ of $n$ arrows. Assume that your left foot starts on \twemoji{left arrow} and your right foot starts on \twemoji{right arrow}, and you have memorised the entire sequence of arrows.

For example, consider the following sequence: \twemoji{up arrow} \twemoji{up arrow} \twemoji{down arrow} \twemoji{down arrow}. We can earn up to two lazy points as follows:

\begin{question}
Let $S$ be a string of $n$ characters. Describe an $O(n^2)$ algorithm to compute the length of the longest substring that appears both forwards and backwards in $S$. The forward and backward substrings should not overlap.

For example, consider the following string \[S = \mathsf{BOBSMAM\textcolor{red!60!black}{ASE}\textcolor{blue!80!black}{ESA}UKULELE}.\] The algorithm should return 3 with the substring $\mathsf{ASE}$.

{\bfseries Hint.} {\em This is very similar to the palindrome problem from tutorials...}
\end{question}

\begin{solution}

\textbf{Subproblems}

Let the string be $1$ indexed.
For $1\leq i, j \leq n$, 
let $P(i, j)$ be the problem of finding the length of the length of the longest 
substring that appears both forwards and backwards in $S[i..j]$ (inclusive at both ends of the range),\
such that the left occurence starts at $i$ and the right occurence ends at $j$,
and there is no overlap between these substrings.

\textbf{Recurrence}

$$\mathrm{opt}(i,j) = \begin{cases}
    1+\mathrm{opt}(i+1, j-1) & \text{if }A[i]=A[j]\\
    0 &\text{otherwise}
\end{cases}    $$

\textbf{Base Cases}

For all $i \geq j$, $\mathrm{opt}(i, j) = 0$.

\textbf{Order of Computation}

Solve the subproblems in increasing order of the difference $j-i$.
In this way, $P(i+1, j-1)$ is guaranteed to be solved before $P(i, j)$.

\textbf{Overall Answer}

$$\max_{\substack{1\leq i\leq j \leq n}} \mathrm{opt}(i, j)$$

\textbf{Time Complexity}

There are $O(n^2)$ subproblems, each taking $O(1)$ to solve.
Extracting the overall answer takes $O(n^2)$ time, giving a total of $O(n^2)$.

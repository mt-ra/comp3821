\begin{question}
Let $S$ be a string of $n$ characters. Describe an $O(n^2)$ algorithm to compute the length of the longest substring that appears both forwards and backwards in $S$. The forward and backward substrings should not overlap.

For example, consider the following string \[S = \mathsf{BOBSMAM\textcolor{red!60!black}{ASE}\textcolor{blue!80!black}{ESA}UKULELE}.\] The algorithm should return 3 with the substring $\mathsf{ASE}$.

{\bfseries Hint.} {\em This is very similar to the palindrome problem from tutorials...}

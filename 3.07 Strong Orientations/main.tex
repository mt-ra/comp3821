\begin{question}
Let $G = (V, E)$ be an undirected graph. A {\em bridge} edge is an edge whose deletion increases the number of connected components in $G$. Think of this as a cut vertex from Task 1.09 but on edges instead. A {\em bridgeless graph} is a graph with no bridge edges. Finally, a {\em strong orientation} assigns each edge of $G$ a direction such that $G$ becomes a strongly connected graph.

Robbins' theorem says that a connected graph $G$ has a strong orientation if and only if $G$ is bridgeless. Therefore, we will only look at bridgeless and connected graphs. Let $G = (V, E)$ be a bridgeless and connected graph. Describe a linear-time algorithm to find a strong orientation of $G$.

{\bfseries Note.} {\em A similar algorithm can be used to find \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ear_decomposition}{ear decompositions}. In the flow networks module, you will describe an algorithm to find $k$-orientations of undirected graphs.}

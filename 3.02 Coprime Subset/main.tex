\begin{question}
Consider the following problem.

\begin{itemize}
    \item[] {\em Let $[n] \coloneqq \{1, \dots, n\}$. What is the size of the largest subset $S \subseteq [n]$ such that every pair of elements in $S$ is coprime?}
\end{itemize}

Let $P_n$ denote the set of primes in $[n]$. It is clear that $S \coloneqq \{1\} \cup P_n$ is a subset that satisfies the condition that every pair of elements in $S$ is coprime. Prove that $\lvert S \rvert$ is correct.

{\bfseries Note.} {\em This implies that the natural greedy algorithm of ``include $x$ iff. $x$ is prime'' returns a subset of maximum cardinality.}

{\bfseries Hint.} {\em There are a few ways to prove this; one way is to define an injection. Another way is to use a standard exchange argument.}
\end{question}

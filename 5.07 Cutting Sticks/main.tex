\begin{question}
You are given a long piece of stick of length $L$. You want to cut the stick into {\em exactly} $n$ places along its length, where the $i$th place to cut occurs at position $A[i]$. Since sticks of larger size require more power, cutting a stick of length $X$ requires $X$ units of work.

\begin{enumerate}[label = (\alph*)]
    \item Given the stick of length $L$ and the positions of the $n$ places to cut $A[1..n]$, describe an $O(n^3)$ algorithm to compute the minimum number of units of work to cut the stick into $n$ pieces.

    \item Describe an $O(n^2)$ algorithm to compute the minimum number of units of work to cut the stick into $n$ pieces.

    {\bfseries Hint.} {\em What can we optimise here?}
\end{enumerate}
\end{question}

    \item Solution to part (b) goes here...

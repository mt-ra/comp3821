\begin{question}
Let $G = (V, E)$ be an undirected graph. A {\em $k$-orientation} assigns each edge a direction such that every vertex of $G$ has {\em at most} $k$ incoming edges. Describe an $O(m^2 \log n)$ algorithm to find the smallest $k$ for which $G$ has a $k$-orientation.

For example, the cube graph should return $2$, as shown below.

\begin{question}
You are given a set of $n$ arcs on the unit circle. For a pair of arcs $a_i$ and $a_j$, assume that you can decide if the intersection of $a_i$ and $a_j$ is empty in $O(1)$ time. Describe an $O(n^2)$ algorithm to return the size of the largest set of non-intersecting arcs.

{\bfseries Hint.} {\em Reduce the problem to the straight line version.}

\begin{question}
Let $A[1..n]$ be a sorted array of $n$ {\em distinct} integers. Some of these integers might be positive, negative, or zero.
\begin{enumerate}[label = (\alph*)]
    \item Describe an $O(\log n)$ algorithm to decide if there exist some index $i$ such that $A[i] = i$.

    {\bfseries Hint.} {\em Consider the array $B[i] = A[i] - i$.}

    \item Now, suppose we know that $A[1] > 0$. Describe an $O(1)$ algorithm to decide if there exist some index $i$ such that $A[i] = i$.

    {\bfseries Hint.} {\em Again, consider the array $B[i] = A[i] - i$.}
\end{enumerate}
\end{question}

\begin{rubric}
\begin{itemize}
    \item You should justify why your algorithm is correct and why they run in the allocated time complexities (or faster!).

    \item This task will form part of the portfolio.
    \item Ensure that your argument is clear and keep reworking your solutions until your lab demonstrator is happy with your work.
\end{itemize}
\end{rubric}

\begin{solution}
\begin{enumerate}[label = (\alph*)]
    \item Consider the array $B[i]=A[i]-i$. We want to show that the elements of $B$ are nondecreasing.
    Assume for the sake of contradiction that there exists a $j$ such that 

    \item Solution to part (b).

\begin{question}
You are given an array $A$ of $n$ integers. Some of these elements are marked as {\em dodgy}, and you want to find the length of the longest increasing subsequence that include at most $k$ dodgy elements. Given an array $A[1..n]$, a boolean array $\compproblem{Dodgy}[1..n]$, and an integer $k$, describe an $O(kn^2)$ algorithm to compute the length of the longest increasing subsequence that contains at most $k$ dodgy elements.

For example, if we have the array \[A = [3^*, 1, 4^*, 1^*, 5, 9, 2^*, 6],\] where all of the dodgy elements are marked by an asterisk $(*)$, then a longest increasing subsequence containing at most 3 dodgy elements is $3^*, 4^*, 5, 9$. Your algorithm should, then, return 4.
\end{question}

\begin{solution}

\textbf{Subproblems}

For $0\leq i \leq n$ and $0\leq j \leq k$, let $P(i,j)$ be the problem of determining
the length of the longest increasing subsequence that contains at most $j$ dodgy elements,
that ends at the $i$-th element. There is a dummy subproblem $P(0, j)$.

\textbf{Recurrence}

$$\mathrm{opt}(i,j) = \begin{cases}
    \displaystyle 1+\max_{\substack{m < i\\A[m] < A[i]}}\mathrm{opt}(m, j-1) & \text{if }A[i]\text{ is dodgy and }j \geq 1\\
    \displaystyle 1+\max_{\substack{m < i\\A[m] < A[i]}}\mathrm{opt}(m, j) & \text{if }A[i]\text{ is not dodgy}\\
    0 &\text{otherwise}
\end{cases}    $$

\textbf{Base Cases}

$P(0, j) = 0$ for all $j$.

\textbf{Order of Computation}

Solve subproblems $P(i, j)$ in increasing order of $j$, and increasing order of $i$ if $j$ is the same.
This guarantees that all subproblems $P(m, j-1)$ and $P(m, j)$ for $m < i$ are solved before $P(i,j)$.

\textbf{Overall Answer}

$$\max_{\substack{1\leq i \leq n}} \mathrm{opt}(i, k)$$

\textbf{Time Complexity}

$O(nk)$ subproblems, each taking $O(n)$ time. Overall answer calculated in $O(n)$, for a total of $O(kn^2)$.

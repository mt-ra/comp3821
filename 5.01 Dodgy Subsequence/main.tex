\begin{question}
You are given an array $A$ of $n$ integers. Some of these elements are marked as {\em dodgy}, and you want to find the length of the longest increasing subsequence that include at most $k$ dodgy elements. Given an array $A[1..n]$, a boolean array $\compproblem{Dodgy}[1..n]$, and an integer $k$, describe an $O(kn^2)$ algorithm to compute the length of the longest increasing subsequence that contains at most $k$ dodgy elements.

For example, if we have the array \[A = [3^*, 1, 4^*, 1^*, 5, 9, 2^*, 6],\] where all of the dodgy elements are marked by an asterisk $(*)$, then a longest increasing subsequence containing at most 3 dodgy elements is $3^*, 4^*, 5, 9$. Your algorithm should, then, return 4.

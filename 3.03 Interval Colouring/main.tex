\begin{question}
You are given a set of $n$ intervals $\mathcal I = \{I_1, \dots, I_n\}$ and $n$ colours. Your goal is to assign each interval a colour such that any two intervals that intersect must be assigned different colours. Describe an $O(n \log n)$ algorithm that assigns each interval a colour and uses the minimum number of colours.

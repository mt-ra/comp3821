\begin{question}
You are given a set of $n$ intervals $\mathcal I = \{I_1, \dots, I_n\}$ and $n$ colours. Your goal is to assign each interval a colour such that any two intervals that intersect must be assigned different colours. Describe an $O(n \log n)$ algorithm that assigns each interval a colour and uses the minimum number of colours.
\end{question}

\begin{solution}
    The overall idea is to go from left to right, only introducing new colours when 
    there are no others available.
    Represent each interval $I_i$ as a start event $s_i$ and an end event $e_i$.
    The event is just a struct which holds the position, as well as a reference to the interval.
    Sort all events by position from left to right, taking $O(n\log n)$ time.

    Keep a stack of colours that are available to use.
    Perform a sweep from left to right,
    when a start event is encountered, colour its corresponding interval with 
    the top colour on the stack, and pop this colour from the stack.
    If the stack is empty, then we must introduce a new colour and place it on the stack, 
    before popping it from the stack and colouring the interval with this colour.
    When an end event is encountered, find the colour of its corresponding interval, 
    and return this colour onto the stack.
    This sweep takes $O(n)$ time. Thus the complexity of the whole algorithm is $O(n\log n)$ dominated by sorting.

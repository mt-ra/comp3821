\begin{question}
Let $G = (V_1 \cup V_2, E)$ be a bipartite graph, where $\lvert V_1 \rvert = \lvert V_2 \rvert = n$ and $\lvert E \rvert = m$. Let the vertices of $V_1$ be denoted by $v_1, \dots, v_n$ and let the vertices of $V_2$ be denoted by $w_1, \dots, w_n$. A matching $M$ is {\em planar} if every pair of edges in $M$ do not cross. More formally, all pair of edges $(v_i, w_j)$ and $(v_{i'}, w_{j'})$ in $M$ satisfy the requirement that $i < i'$ if and only if $j < j'$.

Describe an $O(m^{5/2})$ algorithm that returns the minimum number of planar matchings $M_1, \dots, M_k$ such that each edge in $E$ lies in {\em exactly} one matching $M_i$.

There are at least four approaches.

{\bfseries Approach 1.} {\em Reduce to a problem that you have previously seen, perhaps in the tutorials... this should have running time $O(m^{5/2})$.}

{\bfseries Approach 2.} {\em Use Dilworth's theorem. Construct an appropriate poset, and use the chain-antichain duality. The minimum number of {\bfseries chains} that cover the poset should correspond to the maximum length {\bfseries antichain}. This should have running time $O(m^2)$.}

{\bfseries Approach 3.} {\em Use dynamic programming and reduce to the longest decreasing subsequence problem. This should have running time $O(m\log m)$.}

{\bfseries Approach 4.} {\em Use ordered dictionaries or van Emde Boas trees for the competitive programming enthusiasts. This should have running time $O(m \log\log n)$.}
\end{question}

\begin{solution}
We will construct a poset involving the edges $E$, such that edges are comparable if and only if they do not intersect.
For every pair of edges $(v_i, w_j)$ and $(v_{i'}, w_{j'})$, let $(v_i, w_j) \leq (v_{i'}, w_{j'})$ if and only if $i \leq i'$ and $j \leq j'$.
This satisfies the transitive, reflexive and antisymmetric properties and the set of edges and the $\leq$ relation is a poset.
A planar matching can be represented by a chain on this poset.
To solve for the minimum number of matchings that cover $E$,
we just need to find the minimum number of chains required to cover the poset.
This problem can be solved by using the same flow network as for the proof of Dilworth's Theorem.

For each $e\in E$, we represent it by two vertices $e^+$ and $e^-$. 
Join the supersource $s$ to all `minus'-vertices, and join all `plus'-vertices to the supersink $t$.
Now for all pairs of edges $(e_1, e_2)$ such that $e_1 < e_2$, join $e_1^+$ to $e_2^-$.
All edges should have a capacity of one.
Constructing this flow network takes $O(m^2)$ time, as we are scanning through all pairs of edges.
The number of vertices in this flow network is $O(m)$ and the number of edges on this flow network is $O(m^2)$
The minimum number of chains required to cover the poset is equal to $|E|$ minus the maximum flow through this flow network.
The maximum flow can be solved in $O(m^2\sqrt{m})$ time using Dinic's algorithm, since this flow network represents a bipartite graph.
